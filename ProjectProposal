1. Singleplayer
  - Modelling the tanks
    - Allow for user to customize color/shape?
  - Some predesigned levels
  - Procedural level generator/infinite mode
  - Currency which follows from performance. User can then choose to upgrade:
    - Movement speed
    - Bullet speed
    - Number of bullets in play simultaneously
    - Multiple bullets per shot (spew)
    - Increase ricochet count for bullet (default 1 ricochet)
    - Allow placement of mines?
    - Lives
    - Shield? Set where you want a shield to be around the tank (i.e. behind)
    - Shield size
    
    - ** Implementation of AI **
      - Different AI difficulty with different gameplay styles and perks
      - Would like to attempt evolutionary neural networks
      
2. Multiplayer (if time)
  - Allow users to play as a team against AI or to enter player vs player.
  - Allow users to bet currency for winning
  - Possibly create mobile version? Doubt there will be time.
  
  
  SUBTASKS for project:
    Gameplay
    - Physics, collision detection, movement of tanks, bullet shooting (user input), 
    Design
    - Creating models for tanks (including the various AI (should try to be minimalistic with the least amount of vertices as possible
      to save on performace))
    - Game environment models (level generation)
    - GUI for user to purchase upgrades in a shop - or to customize the tank
    AI
